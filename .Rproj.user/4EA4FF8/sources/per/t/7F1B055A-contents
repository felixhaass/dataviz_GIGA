The course uses the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) (and several add-ons, so-called "packages", including ggplot2). 

In addition, this course heavily relies on the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) software environment to write and execute R scripts and to manage projects. The RStudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment) provides a number of important functions that make using R and ggplot2 easier which we will learn as the course progresses.

Finally, we will make use of a number of R packages from the so-called [`tidyverse`.](https://www.tidyverse.org/) The tidyverse is a collection of packages that make reading, processing and transforming, modeling, and--most importantly for this course--data visualization much easier and straightforward. 

# Installation Instructions
**Important: I assume that you will have installed or updated the following software and R packages, as we won't have time during the workshop to do so.**

## Install R

1. Download the latest pre-compiled version of R from https://cran.r-project.org/ (both Windows/Mac/Linux binaries are available). The latest R version, as of this writing, is R 3.4.3. If you have R already installed, make sure that it's version 3.3 or higher. If it's lower than 3.3 you should update your R version. This can be a bit tricky, but the `installr` package helps with that. Instructions for updating R with the installr package can be found here: https://github.com/talgalili/installr/. 

2. To install R, execute the downloaded binary and follow the instructions on the screen. 

## Install RStudio

1. Download the "Free" version of RStudio at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Binaries are available for all major operating systems. If you have RStudio installed, make sure that you're using RStudio v > 1.0 (to check, open RStudio => Help => About RStudio. In this drop down menu, you'll also find the option to update directly.)
2. Execute the binary file and install RStudio following the instructions on the screen. 

## Install required packages

1. Open RStudio and type (or copy and paste) the following code into the R console on the lower right corner to install the required packages for the course.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
install.packages("tidyverse") # data management and visualization packages, incl. ggplot2
install.packages("readxl") # for reading Excel files
install.packages("haven") # for reading SPSS and Stata files
install.packages("gapminder") # example data sets
install.packages("dotwhisker") # coefficient plots

```

# Make sure your installation works

After following the above instructions, open RStudio (if it isn't already open) and copy and paste the following into the R console and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

```{r makesureitworks1, eval = F, echo = T, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

test_plot <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, 
                                   y = lifeExp, 
                                   group = country)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.4) + 
  facet_wrap(~continent)

print(test_plot)

```

This should produce the following plot:

```{r, eval = T, echo = F, fig.align = "center", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

test_plot <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, 
                                   y = lifeExp, 
                                   group = country)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.4) + 
  facet_wrap(~continent)


print(test_plot)
```
